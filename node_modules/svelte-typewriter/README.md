## Installation

```bash
pnpm i -D svelte-typewriter
```

> `pnpm` is used here just as an example, you can use your package of choice

## Usage

### Component-based approach

In order to use this method, you need to import the Svelte component, and wrap
your elements with the `<Typewriter>` component

```svelte
<script>
    import Typewriter from 'svelte-typewriter'
</script>

<Typewriter>
    <h1>Testing the typewriter effect</h1>
</Typewriter>
```

### Directive-based approach

This method relies on [Svelte actions](https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-element-directives-use-action)
(more specifically, the `use:action` directive), in order to animate your
components with this approach, you must import the directive of the animation
mode you want to use and include it as a attribute on your element

```svelte
<script>
    import { concurrent } from 'svelte-typewriter'
</script>

<p use:concurrent={{ interval: 30 }}>Testing the typewriter effect</p>
```

Each mode has it's own directive, which accepts a single object parameter that
can be used to set the animation props (just like on the component-based approach)

There are just a few limitations of this approach to keep in mind:

- For now, there's no way to have the cursor caret on the text being animated
- Event listeners (like `on:done`) won't be triggered
- Depending on the animation mode you're using, some essential animation
properties must be explicitly specified, because they don't have default values
when used on a directive, otherwise the animation won't work properly, those
include `interval`, `wordInterval`, `writeInterval` and `scrambleDuration`

## Props

The `<Typewriter>` component can receive props that allows to manipulate the
behavior of the resulting animation, these props are divided into the following
groups

- **Settings:** general animation properties
- **Event listeners:** functions executed based on the condition of a trigger
- **Child attributes:** child elements animation properties
- **CSS variables:** styling-related properties

### Settings

| Prop | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `concurrent`, `cascade`, `loop`, `loopOnce`, `loopRandom` or `scramble` | The animation mode to be used | `concurrent` |
| `interval` | `number` or `array` | The interval (in milliseconds) between each letter, you can also pass a array of distinct intervals to mimic human typing | `30` |
| `cursor` | `boolean` | Enables/disables the cursor on the Typewriter animation | `true` |
| `keepCursorOnFinish` | `number` or `boolean` | Keep the cursor visible (indefinitely, or for a given amount of time, in milliseconds) after the animation has finished | `false` |
| `delay` | `number` | The interval (in milliseconds) before the animation starts | `0` |
| `showCursorOnDelay` | `boolean` | (only usable when `delay` is not 0) Shows the cursor during delay period | `false` |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | Enables/disables the typewriter animation | `false` |
| `element` | `string` | Sets the tag that will be used for the container element | `div` |
| `wordInterval` | `number` | **(`loop`, `loopOnce` and `loopRandom` modes only)** Sets the interval (in milliseconds) between each word | `1500` |
| `unwriteInterval` | `number` | **(`loop`, `loopOnce` and `loopRandom` modes only)** The interval (in milliseconds) between each letter unwrite, if not defined it uses `interval` | `30` |
| `scrambleDuration` | `number` | **(`scramble` mode only)** Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of the scramble animation | `3000` |
| `scrambleSlowdown` | `boolean` | **(`scramble` mode only)** Enables/disables the slowdown effect right before the scramble animation ends (only works in scramble mode) | `true` |

#### Modes

You can control the behavior of the typewriter effect by passing specific props to the `<Typewriter>` component, the table below contains information about all modes:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `concurrent` | Apply animation simultaneously on all elements, as opposed to the sequential animation of `cascade` mode |
| `cascade` | Apply animation on all elements sequentially instead of simultaneously |
| `loop` | Cycles the animation between the children elements of the parent `Typewriter` component |
| `loopOnce` | It's very similar to the `loop` mode, but the animation stops once it reaches the last element |
| `loopRandom` | It's very similar to `loop` mode, but instead of cycling the animation in a linear way, it picks a random child element to animate each time |
| `scramble` | Slowly reveals the a word by continuously randomizing all of it's letters for a specific amount of time |

### Event listeners

| Event | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| `on:done` | Is executed at the end of the animation, if used with one of the loop modes, this event will be fired at the end of each loop |

### Child attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data-static` | Marks an element as static, excluding it from receiving animations from the `<Typewriter>` component |

### CSS variables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--cursor-color` | Sets the cursor color (accepts any valid color name, hex code and rgb/rgba values) |
| `--cursor-width` | Sets the cursor width |

## FAQs

#### UMD and IIFE output formats are not supported for code-splitting builds.

From version 2.1.17 onwards, this library makes use of dynamic imports, if your
Rollup configuration `output.format` is set to `iife` or `umd`, consider
setting `inlineDynamicImports` to `true`, otherwise, change `output.format` to
something else, like `esm` (for more details, consider checking [#21](https://github.com/henriquehbr/svelte-typewriter/issues/21))

#### Test suite failed to run: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'

This happens because Jest cannot parse Svelte syntax right away, it needs to be
transformed by `svelte-jester` first, therefore, we must tell Jest to **NOT**
ignore `svelte-typewriter`, as by default, everything inside `node_modules` is
ignored and parsed as-is without any kind of pre-processing, this can be done
by setting the `transformIgnorePatterns` property on your Jest configuration,
example below:

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
    transformIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/(?!(svelte-typewriter)/)"]
}
```
